## Behavioral Humanism Framework

Profiles are evaluated through an integrated framework combining:
- **Daniel Kahneman's Behavioral Economics**: Cognitive biases, decision-making patterns, System 1/2 thinking
- **Abraham Maslow's Humanistic Psychology**: Self-actualization, growth motivation, human needs hierarchy

### Framework Categories

**Behavioral Humanism (7 filterable dimensions):**
1. **Bias Awareness**: Understanding of cognitive biases and mitigation strategies
2. **Growth Motivation**: Intrinsic drivers and learning orientation  
3. **Cognitive Humanism**: Empathy, ethical frameworks, human-centered thinking
4. **Humanistic Cognition**: Creative problem solving and holistic perspective
5. **Human Needs Hierarchy**: Maslow's hierarchy indicators and fulfillment patterns
6. **Self Actualization**: Peak experiences, autonomy, purpose alignment
7. **Behavioral Growth**: Adaptation patterns and resilience indicators

**Tier 1 Expansion (3 modern dimensions - v9.0):**
8. **Technology Relationship**: Technology adoption, digital fluency, AI perspective
9. **Crisis Response**: Stress patterns, failure recovery, uncertainty tolerance
10. **Influence Style**: Persuasion approach, rhetoric style, change mechanism

**Tier 2 Expansion (3 interpersonal dimensions - v10.0):**
11. **Resource Relationship**: Wealth perspective, generosity patterns, financial risk appetite
12. **Time Orientation**: Time horizon, legacy concern, intergenerational thinking
13. **Collaboration Enhancement**: Conflict resolution, mentorship, delegation approach

**Traditional Categories (17 additional):**
- Psychological Profile
- Communication Style & Communication
- Collaboration
- Domain Expertise
- Behavioral Patterns
- Learning
- Values
- Cultural Context
- Temporal Context
- Background & Experience
- And more...
