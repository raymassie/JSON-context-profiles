5. **Human Needs Hierarchy**: Maslow's hierarchy indicators and fulfillment patterns
6. **Self Actualization**: Peak experiences, autonomy, purpose alignment
7. **Behavioral Growth**: Adaptation patterns and resilience indicators

**Tier 1 Expansion (3 modern dimensions - v9.0):**
8. **Technology Relationship**: Technology adoption, digital fluency, AI perspective
9. **Crisis Response**: Stress patterns, failure recovery, uncertainty tolerance
10. **Influence Style**: Persuasion approach, rhetoric style, change mechanism

**Tier 2 Expansion (3 interpersonal dimensions - v10.0):**
